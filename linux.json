	"desc": "Been using Linux for around two years and it feels like a lifetime. Using Linux is a passion and a hobby, but also an utterly integral part of my workflow. I started on Mint, switched to Fedora and now to Arch. I would say I'm somewhat of a power-user, although of course I still have much to learn. Joining any software development team, I'm extremely confident that my knowledge and experience with Linux will be adequate and very useful towards making my, and all my teammates lives easier.",
