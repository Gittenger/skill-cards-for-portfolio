	"desc": "Been using Figma as my primary tool for prototyping application designs for about 3 years. I started with Adobe XD and am also familiar with it. I don't consider myself a pro designer but I'm more than competent at using all tools provided by these prototyping softwares. If need be, I'm capable of designing a user interface using such a tool and have quite a lot of experience practicing this.",
