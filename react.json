	"desc": "I've used React almost as long as I've been developing. I jumped right into the MERN stack and never looked back. I've got experience with all of its ins and outs, and have used it to create the client-side of most of my apps. I've used about every styling method you can think of using with React, and these days I always configure my webpack from scratch for my projects. I have created many of my own React templates and have quite a few components and hooks I've added to my own personal, reusable library.",
